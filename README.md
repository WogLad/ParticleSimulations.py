# How to Use

- Clone the repository locally.
- Install python and pygame.
- Run `sand_sim.py`

# Features

- Holding down left-click creates sand particles at the position of your mouse.
- Holding down right-click creates water particles at the position of your mouse.
- Holding down the middle-mouse button removes the particle at the position of your mouse.

# Making Changes

- You can go through `sand_sim.py` to change the buttons to change the pressed to create water or sand.
- You can even change the dimensions of the block spawned in the beginning or even remove it from the code entirely.
- You can change the `screen_width` and `screen_height` variables to change the dimensions of the screen but the simulation might slow down drastically if your ram is not high enough.
